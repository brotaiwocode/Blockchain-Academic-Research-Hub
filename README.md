# Blockchain Academic Research Hub

## Overview

The **Blockchain Academic Research Hub** is a decentralized platform designed to manage academic manuscript submissions and access control using blockchain technology. Built using the Stacks blockchain, the platform ensures secure publication management, allowing researchers to submit, update, withdraw, and transfer ownership of their manuscripts in a transparent and tamper-proof environment.

By leveraging blockchain, this project aims to improve the integrity and accessibility of academic research publications.

## Features

- **Submit Manuscripts:** Researchers can submit academic manuscripts, including metadata such as title, abstract, categories, and file size.
- **Update Manuscripts:** Authors can update the details of their manuscripts, including title, abstract, and categories.
- **Withdraw Manuscripts:** Authors can withdraw or remove their manuscripts from the repository at any time.
- **Transfer Ownership:** Manuscript ownership can be transferred between researchers, ensuring proper credit is given.
- **Access Control:** Each manuscript has access rights managed by blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing unauthorized access.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain:** Stacks Blockchain (Clarity Smart Contracts)
- **Programming Language:** Clarity (A smart contract language for Stacks)
- **Storage:** On-chain data management for manuscript metadata, access rights, and ownership records.

## Architecture

The system consists of the following key components:

1. **Manuscript Storage**: All manuscripts and their associated metadata (name, author, file size, abstract, categories) are stored in the blockchain.
2. **Access Control**: Access to manuscripts is restricted based on blockchain records, allowing for fine-grained control over who can read or modify manuscripts.
3. **Ownership Management**: Researchers can transfer manuscript ownership, ensuring academic credit is properly managed.

## Smart Contract Functions

### Public Functions:
- **`submit-manuscript`**: Allows a researcher to submit a new manuscript.
- **`withdraw-manuscript`**: Lets the manuscript owner withdraw a manuscript from the platform.
- **`update-manuscript`**: Allows the manuscript author to update their manuscript's metadata.
- **`transfer-authorship`**: Lets the manuscript owner transfer authorship to another researcher.

### Error Handling:
The contract handles errors such as unauthorized access, invalid manuscript data, file size limitations, and duplicate submissions.

## Setup & Installation

To deploy and use this contract, you need to:

1. Install the [Stacks CLI](https://github.com/stacks-network/stacks-blockchain).
2. Set up a Stacks wallet for transaction signing.
3. Deploy the contract on a testnet or mainnet (for production use).

### Example Usage:

#### Submitting a Manuscript:
```javascript
submit-manuscript('Research on Blockchain', 1024, 'This paper discusses the impact of blockchain on research.', ['Blockchain', 'Decentralization']);
```

#### Withdrawing a Manuscript:
```javascript
withdraw-manuscript(1); // Withdraw manuscript with ID 1
```

#### Transferring Ownership:
```javascript
transfer-authorship(1, 'principal-address-of-new-author');
```
